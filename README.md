Predicting Term Deposit Subscription for Banco de Portugal

Background on Bank Marketing Strategies:

Banks, like Banco de Portugal, often employ direct marketing campaigns to promote financial products, such as term deposits. These campaigns typically involve reaching out to potential customers through phone calls to persuade them to subscribe to these products. The success of such campaigns relies on understanding customer behavior, preferences, and financial needs. However, these marketing efforts are not without challenges.

Challenges Faced by Banks:

Client Engagement: Customers may receive multiple calls, leading to fatigue and decreased interest in the product. Engaging clients effectively without overwhelming them is a significant challenge.

Data Management: Managing and analyzing large volumes of client data is crucial for targeting the right customers and personalizing the marketing approach.

Predictive Accuracy: Predicting whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on various factors is challenging. Factors like previous campaign outcomes, client demographics, and economic conditions play a role in this decision.

Regulatory Compliance: Banks must adhere to strict regulations regarding customer data usage and marketing practices, which can limit the flexibility of their campaigns.

Project Objective:

Task in this project is to analyze the marketing campaign data from Banco de Portugal and develop a predictive model to determine whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on the available data. The classification goal is to predict the binary outcome (yes/no) for each client.

Dataset Information:

Dataset consists of 45,211 instances and 16 features related to client demographics, campaign contact details, and previous campaign outcomes.

Key Features:

Client Demographics: Age, job, marital status, education, balance, default, housing, loan. Campaign Details: Contact type, last contact day, month, duration, number of contacts during the campaign. Previous Campaign Outcomes: Number of days since the last contact, number of previous contacts, and outcome of the previous campaign. Target Variable: Whether the client subscribed to a term deposit (yes/no).

Project Tasks:

Data Exploration: Understand the dataset, check for missing values, and explore the distribution of features. Feature Engineering: Consider creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance. Note the importance of excluding the 'duration' feature for a realistic predictive model. Model Development: Use machine learning techniques to build a classification model that predicts the likelihood of a client subscribing to a term deposit. Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Reporting: Document your findings, including insights gained from the data, the model's performance, and any challenges faced during the project.

Expected Outcome:

By the end of this project, you should have a well-documented model that can accurately predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit. This model could potentially help Banco de Portugal improve the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns by targeting the right customers more effectively.
